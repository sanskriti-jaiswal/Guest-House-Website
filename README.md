"Welcome to my project Kingsukh Guest House Website"
This is a web development project that i created as a web developer intern at Innobyte Services.
This project is a redesign of kingsukh guest house website. I created a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively promotes the guest house's services and attracts potential customers.
It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The site is fully functional and responsive. it has been tested on different devices for efficient working and avoiding bugs and compatibility issues.
The requirements have been kept in mind:
- Focused on improving aesthetics, navigation, and overall user engagement.
- Developed the redesigned website using selected technologies.
- Implemented responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices and screen sizes.
- Enhanced user experience with smooth animations, transitions, and interactive elements.
